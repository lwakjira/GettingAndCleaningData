# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository contains the following files:
A) run_analysis.R that does the following. 
  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity     and each subject

B) CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed in run_analysis.R to clean up the data 

C) all_average.txt is a text file that contains the tidy dataset created in step 5 of run_analysis.R
